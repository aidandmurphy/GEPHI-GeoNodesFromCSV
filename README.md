# Addings this readme very much later...

## Why i made this
This is a program designed specifically for a project for my linear algebra class senior year of highschool, I do not intend to keep this updated but it could be helpful if anyone else finds themselves needing to process data from the Geographical data of MTA Subway Stations into a organized list of GEPHI nodes.

## How to use
'csv_maker.py' takes an input of the MTA entrances csv file and exports a list of nodes.
'edgeparser.py' takes the nodes and makes (from what my memory recalls) a list of edges with ridership data between them. (hopefully)
## ---
This project can probably be much more adapted to more complex and useful use cases other than a graph theory project.
